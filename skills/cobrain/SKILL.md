name: cobrain
description: Use when the user mentions their brain, Cobrain, their notes or memory, or names a client, project, student or anything else they track there; when they ask what was decided, what happened recently or where something is written; or when something worth keeping comes up during the work (a decision, a finding, a status to resume later).

# Working with Cobrain

Cobrain is the user's persistent memory: Markdown notes in folders, shared by every AI they connect to it. What you write here is what the next conversation (yours or another AI's) will know.

## Read before you work

- **The user names something they track** (a client, a project, a student…): call `start_session` with that name first. It returns the brain's rules, the unit's `_about.md`, its decisions and its latest changes.
- **You need the details**: `load_context` on the sub-folder that matters, not on the whole brain.
- **You don't know where something is**: `search` for words in the text, `find_notes` for a name or a path (also to resolve a `[[wikilink]]`). Search excerpts are not the note: `read_file` the path before you answer from it.
- **"What happened lately?"**: `recent_changes`.
- **You don't remember a unit's name**: `list_units`.

## Write while you work, not at the end

Save what should outlive the conversation as soon as it happens: decisions and why, findings, the status of a task and what to resume.

- **Adding to a note that exists**: `append_file`. It never conflicts and never loses text.
- **New note**: `write_file`. On an existing note, `write_file` REPLACES the whole content: pass the `base` version you got from `read_file`, and never use it to add a line.
- **Decisions** go at the end of the unit's `decisions.md` with `append_file`. Facts about the unit live in its `_about.md`.
- **Files** (images, PDFs, logos): `attach_file`.
- Search before creating: updating the right note is better than a duplicate.
- `move_file` and `delete_file` change the user's brain for every AI: ask before using them.

## Conventions

- Special file names are English in every brain: `_about.md`, `_ai.md`, `decisions.md`, `_templates/`.
- A `/` inside a title creates a folder: write "Serie D and Under 19", not "Serie D / Under 19".
- One paragraph is one line: don't wrap text at a fixed width.
- New unit: `start_project`, then `create_unit` from a template.

## When it fails

- **The Cobrain tools are not available at all**: the plugin's connector was never connected on this account. Tell the user to open Customize > Plugins > Cobrain > Connectors and connect Cobrain (in Claude Code: `/mcp`, then authenticate `cobrain`), then start a new conversation.
- **The tools answer with an authorization or connection error**: don't retry in a loop. The connection expired: disconnect Cobrain in the same Connectors tab, connect it again and sign in with the same email. Their notes are safe.
